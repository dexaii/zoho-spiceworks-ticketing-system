# Lessons Learned
This project was a rich learning experience that pushed me to expand my technical skills. It was the first time I configured a mail server and set up DNS records for email delivery, which proved to be technically challenging but ultimately very rewarding. Working through tasks like domain verification, MX record configuration, and setting up SPF/DKIM authentication gave me a hands-on understanding of how email systems operate. Although the learning curve was steep, each problem overcame (from verifying the domain via TXT records to ensuring emails were't flagged as spam) demonstrate the operation of email infrustructure from inside. In the end, I gained confidence in configuring and managing a custom email system from scratch.
Importantly, the project helped me develop transferable IT support and systems thinking skills. I had to troubleshoot issues at the interconnection of different systems (DNS, email, and Spiceworks Cloud), which improved my problem-solving abilities. I learned to think logically for instance, when an email wasn't arriving, I would verify DNS settings, check Zoho Mail's configuration, and consider Spicework's limitations as part of a single connected workflow

# Project difficulties
Integrating the Zoho Mail server with Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk was another significant challenge. Due to platform limitations, the "integration" was largely simulated rather than fully automated. Spiceworks Cloud free plan doesn't support email forwarding and/or IMAP/POP3 protocols, which means I couldn't connect the helpdesk env with my mail server in real time. Insted, I got away by using alternative workflows: manually copying emails from the Zoho inbox into Spiceworks tickets (Mannual - Spiceworks Portal), or relying on the Spiceworks-provided email address for ticket intake. I was able to simulate the entire ticket lifecycle - from receiving a support request to sending an acknowledgment and finally closing the ticket - using the Spiceworks interface.

# Conclusion
Overall, it was my first project related to mail server configuration and cloud helpdesk environment integration. The project has greatly boosted my confidence as a person who just started IT journey. I successfully set up a business email system and simulated functional helpdesk environment, gaining clearer insight into real-world IT operations.
If I were to approach a similar project again, I would take time at the  research limitations of the chosen services, and if needed, options for the alternatives (or budget for upgrades) to ensure key requirements are met.
