# Zoho Mail Domain Setup on Hostinger
Note: This document outlines the steps to configure DNS records on Hostinger for using Zoho Mail with your custom domainl. We will verify the domain ownership and set up email delivery and authentication records. We will use a TXT record for domain verification, connecting MX record to email route to Zoho, set up Anti-spoofing - SPF and DKIM for email authentication.

## Accessing Hostinger DNS settings
**1.** Login in to Hostinger and select your domain

**2.** Click `Manage` and on the left side bar click `DNS / Nameservers`

**3.** Under `DNS records` tap select  `Manage DNS records` you should see a list of existing DNS records and option to **Add Record**. We will use this interface to add the required TXT, MX, SPF, and DKIM records.

## TXT Record - Domain Verification
**1.** To provide ownership of your domain to Zoho, you need to add a TXT record that Zoho provides. Verifying your domain using the TXT method involves three major steps:
* Copying the unique TXT value from Zoho Mail Admin Console.
* Adding the value as a TXT record to your domain's DNS Manager.
* Verifying the added TXT record from the Zoho Mail Admin Console.

**2.**  Login to your Zoho Mail `admin console`, and select `Domains` on the leftside bar. Choose your Hostinger domain that you want to verify
* At the Verify Domain Ownership section of your domain, choose the Add a TXT record in the DNS option from the drop-down list.
*  Copy the text hash generated by Zoho and past it into your domain DNS settings
**3.** In your DNS provider, Add Record, Locate the option to add TXT records.
* In the Name/ Host/ Alias/ TXT, enter @ or leave it blank.
* In the Value/ Points To/ Destination field, add the Zoho Mail verification hash—zoho-verification=zb********.zmverify.zoho.***.

**4.** Comeback to Zoho Mail and verify Domain.

## MX Records (Mail Exchange)
MX(Mail Exchange) records direct email for your domain to the mail server. By setting Zoho MX records, you tell internet that Zoho will handle incoming emails for your domain.

**1.** Add the following MX records to your DNS settings:

* Where is the `Priority` is a Zoho’s mail servers for the default data center. The priority values ensure mail is tried at the primary server first (priority 10) other two are backups

**2.** Make sure to delete all MX records not related to Zoho Mail

**3.** Verify MX record on Zoho Mail part

## SPF Records (Sender Policy Framework) - Anti Spoofing
SPF record is one of `email authentication triad` email authentication protocols. SPF is a text record that helps to prevent spammers from sending emails pretending to be from your domain "Spoofing".

**1.** Add the following TXT record to your DNS settings:

**2.** Verify SPF record on Zoho Mail side

## DKIM Records (Domain Key Identified Mail)
DKIM record is one of `email authentication triad` email authentication protocols. DKIM is an email validation system that uses encryption to add a digital signature to all of your outgoing emails, and recipients can verify that the email was indeed sent from your domain and wasn’t tampered with.

**1.** Add the following record to your DNS settings:

**2.** Verify SPF record on Zoho Mail side

## DMARC Records (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) - Anti Spamming, Spoofing, Phishing attack
`Note:` DMARC records is optional.DMARC record is one of `email authentication triad` email authentication protocols. And it can only be configured if SPF and DKIM protocols are configured. DMARC allows the sender to indicate that their emails are protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and instructs the receivers about the action, like quarantine or reject the message, if both the SPF and DKIM checks fail

**1.** Setting up DMARC protocol
* Login to your DNS settings and create a TXT record
* Enter TXT record_dmarc.<yourdomain.com>
* Enter a TXT record value "v=DMARC1;  `p=none` rua=mailto:admin@<yourdomain.com>
![alt text](DMARC-record.png)

**2.** Where `p` is  a policy state phase:
* Where Phase 1  `p=none` - Accept all emails (Recommended)
* Where Phase 2 `p=quarantine` - Will send emails that failed validation to spam
* Where Phase 3 `p=reject` - Reject all unauthorized emails

**3.** Verify DMARC record on Zoho Mail side
